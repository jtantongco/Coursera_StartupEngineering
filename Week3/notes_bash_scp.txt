both depend on .ssh/config being set up properly

scp hello.txt awshost1:~/
scp hello.txt awshost1:~/foo.txt

scp src dest
rsync -avp src dest (same format as scp in examples above)

*note when uploading .sh files
1) chmod 777 __Filename__.sh
2) ./__Filename__.sh *if you are in the same folder 

compress a file as a tar file
tar -cvf __filename__.tar __folder__
